            <h1>Mathematics: Where Equations Tell the Story.</h1>
            <p>Math helps strengthen reasoning skills and critical thinking. It helps us think analytically about the world and reason logically.<br>
                 The same steps you take to understand a problem, identify the knows and unknows and then solve it, 
                can be applied to other areas of your life.</p>

            <h3>Mathematics</h3>
            <p>Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and change. 
                Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, 
                and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="course-col"> 
            <h3>General Mathematics</h3>
            <p>General Mathematics aims to develop learners' understanding of concepts and techniques drawn from number and algebra, trigonometry and world geometry, 
                sequences, finance, networks and decision mathematics and statistics, in order to solve applied problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>PreCalculus</h3>
            <p>Precalculus is a course, or a set of courses, that includes algebra and trigonometry at a level which is designed to prepare students for the study of calculus, thus the name precalculus. 
                Schools often distinguish between algebra and trigonometry as two separate parts of the coursework.</p>
